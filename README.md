My first Repository?!?! Check me out! ;)

I've just discovered the world of branches within working with Repositories on GitHub and how they allow for version control with regard to making changes to an app ie: features...or so I believe from what I understand so far. This is a message within a secondary branch of the hello-world repository. Meaning this is a different version of the original repo with this being the single difference between the two.
 Intriguing how this editor is responsive. I love this. <3
